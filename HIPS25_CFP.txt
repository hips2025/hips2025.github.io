HIPS 2025: The 30th International Workshop on High-Level Parallel Programming Models and Supportive Environments
to be held in conjunction with IPDPS 2025

May 27-31, 2025
Milan, Lombardy, Italy

[Introduction]
The 30th HIPS workshop, to be held as a full-day meeting at the IPDPS 2025 conference in Milan, Lombardy, Italy, focuses on high-level programming of multiprocessors, compute clusters, and massively parallel machines. Like previous workshops in this series - established in 1996 - this event serves as a forum for research in the areas of parallel applications, language design, compilers, runtime systems, and programming tools. It provides a timely forum for scientists and engineers to present the latest ideas and findings in these rapidly changing fields. In our call for papers, we especially invite papers demonstrating innovative approaches in the areas of emerging programming models for large-scale parallel systems and many-core architectures. This year we will add to the list topics programming models and environments for the Edge-Cloud-HPC Continuum as well as the application of recent AI technologies in high-level programming models.

[Topics of the workshop]
Topics of interest to the HIPS workshop include but are not limited to:

	-  High-level and domain-specific programming systems
	-  Language/compiler support for AI/ML and Cybersecurity/Privacy (e.g., ML-based auto-tuning)
	-  Application of Large Language Models in high-level programming environments
	-  Higher-level programming support for quantum computing/quantum simulation
	-  Programming Models and Tools for the	Edge-Cloud-HPC Continuum
	-  Task-based programming systems
	-  (Scalable) programming tools and tools for power & performance analysis, modeling, monitoring and debugging, and core correctness
	-  Compiler analysis and optimization techniques
	-  OS and architectural support for parallel programming and debugging
	-  Software and system support for extreme scalability including fault tolerance and power-aware HPC
	-  Programming environments for	heterogeneous multicore systems and accelerators such as GPUs and FPGAs
	-  Solutions for programming paradigms for GPUs from different hardware vendors
	-  Dynamism in applications and system resources
	-  Performance portability
	-  Efforts for improving the sustainability of scientific software
	-  Languages and runtime support for multi-science/coupled codes, including but	not limited to ensemble computing and uncertainty quantification
	-  New programming languages and constructs for exploiting parallelism and locality

[Manuscript submission]
Authors are invited to submit original papers in two separate tracks:
	- Full papers may not exceed 10 single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11 inch pages (IEEE conference style), including figures, tables, and references. The authors, if accepted, will have the opportunity to present their work during the workshop.
	- Short papers may not exceed 4 single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11 inch pages (IEEE conference style), including figures, tables, and references. The authors, if accepted, will have the opportunity to give a short presentation during the workshop.
All submissions should be formatted according to the IPDPS paper style (IEEE conference style, single-blind).
Please submit papers through the IPDPS-HIPS Linklings site:

[Proceedings]
The accepted full papers will be published in the IPDPS 2025 Workshops proceedings by the IEEE Xplore Digital Library.
(Short papers will not appear in the proceedings.)
Presentation of an accepted paper at the conference is a requirement of publication.
Any paper that is not presented at the conference will not be included in IEEE Xplore.
