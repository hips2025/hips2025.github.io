# 30th International Workshop on High-Level Parallel Programming Models and Supportive Environments

# Overview
The 30th HIPS workshop, to be held as a full-day meeting at the IPDPS 2025 conference in Milan, Lombardy, Italy, focuses on high-level programming of multiprocessors, compute clusters, and massively parallel machines. Like previous workshops in this series - established in 1996 - this event serves as a forum for research in the areas of parallel applications, language design, compilers, runtime systems, and programming tools. It provides a timely forum for scientists and engineers to present the latest ideas and findings in these rapidly changing fields. In our call for papers, we especially invite papers demonstrating innovative approaches in the areas of emerging programming models for large-scale parallel systems and many-core architectures. This year we will add to the list topics programming models and environments for the Edge-Cloud-HPC Continuum as well as the application of recent AI technologies in high-level programming models.

**Title: Architecture and Programming of Analog In-Memory- Computing Accelerators for Deep Neural Networks** \\
**Dr. HsinYu (Sidney) Tsai (IBM Research)**

Abstract: \\
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated revolutionary capabilities in AI, such as machine vision, natural language processing, and content generation. However, the growing energy usage due to the excessive amount of data communication between compute and memory units highlights the need to address the “Von Neumann bottleneck.” In-memory computing can achieve high throughput and energy efficiency by computing multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations using Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s current law on arrays of resistive memory devices.
In recent years, Analog non-volatile memory (NVM)-based accelerators with energy-efficient, weight-stationary MAC operations in analog NVM memory-array “Tiles” have been demonstrated in hardware using Phase Change Memory (PCM) devices integrated in the backend of 14-nm CMOS. Based on the hardware demonstrations, we propose a highly heterogeneous and programmable accelerator architecture that takes advantage of a dense and efficient circuit-switched 2D mesh. This flexible architecture can accelerate Transformer, Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM), and Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) while keeping data communication local and massively parallel. We show that by co-optimizing memory devices, DNN algorithms, and specialized digital circuits, competitive end-to-end DNN accuracies can be obtained with the help of hardware-aware training.
The author would like to thank all colleagues at IBM Research Almaden, Yorktown, Albany NanoTech, Zurich and Tokyo for their contributions to this work and the IBM Research AI HW Center.

Biography: \\
HsinYu (Sidney) Tsai received her Ph.D. from the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2011. After graduation, Sidney joined the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center and developed directed self-assembly (DSA) lithography for finFETs. Sidney managed an Advanced Lithography group in 2016, overseeing operations of a 200mm research prototyping line. She now works in the Almaden Research Center in San Jose, CA, as a Principal Research Staff Member and manager of the Analog AI group, focusing on training and inference of Deep Neural Networks using emerging non-volatile memories, such as Phase Change Memory.
