# Overview
The 28th HIPS workshop, proposed as a full-day meeting at the IEEE IPDPS 2023
conference in St. Petersburg, Florida, USA, focuses on high-level programming
of multiprocessors, compute clusters, and massively parallel machines.
Like previous workshops in the series, which was established in 1996,
this event will serve as a forum for research in the areas of parallel
applications, language design, compilers, runtime systems, and programming
tools. It provides a timely forum for scientists and engineers to present the
latest ideas and findings in these rapidly changing fields. In our call for
papers, we especially encouraged innovative approaches in the areas of emerging
programming models for large-scale parallel systems and many-core architectures.

# Important Deadlines
Submission due date: January 19th, 2023 Anywhere on Earth (AoE)

10-point size font on 8.5x11 inch pages (IEEE conference style), including
figures, tables, and references.

**Short papers** may not exceed 4 single-spaced double-column pages using
10-point size font on 8.5x11 inch pages (IEEE conference style), including
